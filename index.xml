So lets dive into part 2!
We ended the first part with Drarwing working on the Raspberry, and the Raspberry set up the way we would like it. However, an important part of the story is still missing: We can&amp;rsquo;t see any of it. It&amp;rsquo;s time to give it a physical presence.
When I started the build, I had a general idea what I wanted it to look like.</description></item><item><title>Making virtual art physical - Part 1</title><link>https://jayke.nl/posts/physical-virtual-art-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2024 13:54:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jayke.nl/posts/physical-virtual-art-1/</guid><description>Time for my first actual post!

do something with the jayke.nl domain that I&amp;rsquo;ve had for a long time play around with some static site generation tooling and create a place where I can jot down some of my thoughts, or indulge in shameless self-promotion over some of the hobby projects I have done. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what comes of this. I&amp;rsquo;ll figure out over time whether I have anything relevant to share.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://jayke.nl/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jayke.nl/about/</guid><description>Hi, my name is Jayke Meijer. I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer, data engineer, computer &amp;amp; network security geek and hobby-grade electronics nerd from The Netherlands.
When I am not doing computer stuff, I enjoy (working on) classic cars and doing outdoor, adrenaline inducing sports like mountainbiking and skiing. The latter I enjoy doing as a teacher and trainer too, spending time in the Tyrolian alps as instructor.</description></item></channel></rss>
