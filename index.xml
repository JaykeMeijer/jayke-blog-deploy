I figured it was time to
do something with the jayke.nl domain that I&amp;rsquo;ve had for a long time play around with some static site generation tooling and create a place where I can jot down some of my thoughts, or indulge in shameless self-promotion over some of the hobby projects I have done.

I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer, data engineer, computer &amp;amp; network security geek and hobby-grade electronics nerd from The Netherlands.
When I am not doing computer stuff, I enjoy (working on) classic cars and doing outdoor, adrenaline inducing sports like mountainbiking and skiing. The latter I enjoy doing as a teacher and trainer too, spending time in the Tyrolian alps as instructor.</description></item></channel></rss>
